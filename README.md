# Student-Management-System
In this project we have developed a web application in which we are required to digitalized simple paper grading system of school in order to achieve better overview and management of the test results and the overall performance of every student. Furthermore, it will also allow teachers and students to communicate more effectively. So, this new system has an effective user rights management system in place, as well as various views for different user roles.
This student management system’s main focus is to implement simple and fast method for teachers to manage their student’s results and some export capabilities to obtain a summary of assessments and subjects for both students and teachers. In addition, a simple communication message system has been built.
There are three different users (Admin, Student and Teacher) in this system. Admin has all type of access e.g., admin can add, delete, edit and access each and every type of data in the system. Whenever new user wants to get access of this system, admin will create his/her account and allow access according to their roles.
We have use CRUD Rest APIs for the communication between frontend and backend. User can easily access their data from database from frontend.
